# YouTubeSpamCommentFilter

Hey this is my short implementation of Spam Comments Indentification of YouTube Videos.

1. Change the PATH for the Chrome Driver in the file 'YouTubeComments.py'
1. Run 'YouTubeComments.py'
2. Paste your URL in the terminal when it asks.
3. Now wait until it performs the action.
4. Output will be the Spam Comments in that YouTube Video
